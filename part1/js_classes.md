### Summary: Classes

JavaScript does not have a traditional class mechanism like other object-oriented programming languages, but ES6 introduced a class syntax that simplifies the creation of class-like structures. The provided example defines a `Person` class with a constructor and a method, creating two instances of the class. Despite the class-like syntax, JavaScript objects are still fundamentally based on prototypal inheritance. The ES6 class syntax, while controversial, is often used in older versions of React and Node.js, though it's not necessary for learning modern React with Hooks, which is the focus of the course.

Interesting:
JavaScript essentially defines the types

- Boolean
- Number
- String

but also

- Null
- Undefined
- Symbol
- BigInt
- Object.
